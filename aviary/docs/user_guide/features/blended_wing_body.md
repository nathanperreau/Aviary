# Blended Wing Body Modeling

## GASP Based Geometry

Comparing to traditional tube and wing model, Blended wing body (BWB) modeling has four major new changes in geometry subsystems:

- partially buried engine in fuselage,
- Fuselage layout and size parameters,
- Computation of wing tank fuel volume (either with wing fold or not),
- Exposed wing area computation.

We will explain some details of each feature in this document.

### Partially Buried Engine in Fuselage

In a BWB, an engine can be partially buried in fuselage. Supposed that the nacelle has the diameter $D$ and the buried diameter is $d$. In Aviary, we denote the ratio $x = d/D$. So, $0 \le x \le 1$. This variable is called `Aircraft.Nacelle.PERCENT_DIAM_BURIED_IN_FUSELAGE`. Then the percentage of perimeter not buried in fuselage is $f(x) = 1 - \arccos(2*(0.5 -x))/\pi$. Clearly, if the nacelle is not buried in fuselage at all, then $x = 0$ and $f(x) = 1$. Note that function $f(x)$ has infinity derivatives at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. We have to use two cubic functions instead near the two ends. This is shown in the following image:

The wetted area of nacelle can be computed as usual but scaled down by a factor $f(x)$.

### Fuselage Layout

In the current implementation, a few parameters are fixed for first class cabin:

| Parameters | Values | Units |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| length of first class lav, galley & closet | 8.0 | ft |
| first class seat width | 28.0 | inch |
| first class seat pitch | 36.0 | inch |
| Number of aisles in first class | 2 | unitless |
| First class aisle width | 24.0 | inch |
| Length of first class/tourist class aisle | 5.0 | ft |
| Tourist class passengers per lav | 78 | unitless |
| Lav width | 42.0 | inch |
| Tourist class galley area per passenger | 0.15 | ft**2 |
| | | |

Aviary will try to fit the seats in both first class and tourist class based on the above and following parameters:

| Parameters | Units |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.SEAT_WIDTH | inch |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.NUM_AISLES | unitless |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.AISLE_WIDTH | inch |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.SEAT_PITCH | inch |
| Aircraft.CrewPayload.Design.NUM_PASSENGERS | unitless |
| Aircraft.CrewPayload.Design.NUM_FIRST_CLASS | unitless |
| Aircraft.BWB.FOREBODY_SWEEP | deg |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.PILOT_COMPARTMENT_LENGTH | ft |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.AVG_DIAMETER | ft |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.PRESSURIZED_WIDTH_ADDITIONAL | ft |
| nose_length | ft |
| | |

The output is the fuselage station of aft pressure bulkhead. If there is no first class cabin, please set `Aircraft.CrewPayload.Design.NUM_FIRST_CLASS` to 0.0.

The fuselage size group is shown as follows:

### Wing Fuel Volume Computation

For the wing fuel volume, we first compute its value assuming no wing fold structure. In
the case of wing fold, a simple adjustment model from the first computation for the wing fuel volume is implemented using linear interpolation plus factors for wing thickness.

### Exposed Wing Area Computation

For blended wing body aircraft, the exposed wing area refers to the wing section that is not fully integrated or blended into the fuselage, but rather extends outwards, potentially with a distinct edge or separation from the body. It must be computed separately and it will be used in angle of attack computation.

One of the dependent parameters is `Aircraft.Wing.VERTICAL_MOUNT_LOCATION` (denoted by $x$, where $0 \le x \le 1$, unitless). Giving $x$, the body half span at the wing location depends on function $f(x) = \sqrt{(0.25 - (0.5 - x)^2)}$. Since $f(x)$ has infinite derivatives at the two ends, we must create two cubic polynomials instead near the ends. The implementation is similar to that of partially buried engine in fuselage and we skip the details here.

Other design parameters are:

| Parameters | Units |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.AVG_DIAMETER | ft |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.HEIGHT_TO_WIDTH_RATIO | unitless |
| Aircraft.Wing.SPAN | ft |
| Aircraft.Wing.TAPER_RATIO | unitless |
| Aircraft.Wing.AREA | ft**2 |
| | |

### Outputs from Wing Group

Several geometric parameters are used:

| Parameters | Units |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Aircraft.Wing.ASPECT_RATIO | unitless |
| Aircraft.Wing.TAPER_RATIO | unitless |
| Aircraft.Wing.SWEEP | deg |
| Aircraft.Wing.THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_ROOT | unitless |
| Aircraft.Fuselage.AVG_DIAMETER | ft |
| Aircraft.Wing.THICKNESS_TO_CHORD_TIP | unitless |
| Aircraft.LandingGear.MAIN_GEAR_LOCATION | ft |
| Aircraft.Wing.TAPER_RATIO | unitless |
| Aircraft.Fuel.WING_FUEL_FRACTION | unitless |
| | |

In BWB model, we assume that the wing has no strut. 

If the wing has fold, then an additional geometric parameter is needed:

| Parameters | Units |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Aircraft.Wing.FOLDED_SPAN | ft |
| | |

The wing group is shown as follows (assuming no fold):

![Wing computation](../images/BWB_GASP_wing_Geom_no_fold.png)

If we add fold structure, the diagram has two more components `BWBWingFoldArea` and 
`BWBWingFoldVolume`. Let us de-emphasize other components by compressing all their inputs
and outputs that are not related to fold structure. We also do not show dimensional and non-dimensional conversion of fold calculation.

## GASP Base Mass

After the changes in geometry, several mass computation must be updated. Comparing to traditional tube and wing model, Blended wing body (BWB) modeling has four major new changes in mass subsystems:

- Computation of various design load speeds,
- Computation of air conditioning mass and furnishing mass,
- Computation of BWB fuselage,
- Computation of wing mass for BWB

### Design Load

In the case of tube + wing design, we assume a given
 wing loading. In the case of BWB, wing loading is replaced by gross mass over exposed wing area:

<p align="center">wing loading = gross mass / exposed wing area</p>

### Equipments Masses and Useful Load

Air conditioning mass and furnishing mass are part of equipments and useful load masses. In the case of tube + wing design, Aviary uses `Aircraft.Fuselage.AVG_DIAMETER` as cabin width. In the case of BWB, this parameter must be replaced by hydraulic diameter (`Aircraft.Fuselage.HYDRAULIC_DIAMETER`). To compute hydraulic diameter, we use cabin width and cabin height to obtain the cabin cross area and then:

<p align="center">hydraulic diameter = (4 * (fuselage cross area) / Ï€)<sup>1/2<sup></p>

### Fuselage Mass

Because of the shape of BWB, the computation of fuselage mass is quite different from conventional aircraft. It is basically an empirical equation based on collected data.

### Wing Mass

In the wing mass computation of conventional aircraft, we assume the cabin width (or fuselage width) is small. But that is not the case for BWB. So, for BWB, wing span is replaced by:

<p align="center">wing span - cabin width</p>

All other steps are the same.
